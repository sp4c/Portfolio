## About Me
Hi, I'm Zack. Before I was 13, I was learning to program. Since then, i've competed in CTF competitions, regularly scoring high on the leaderboards like in NCL Spring 2025 and NSA Codebreakers 2024 and 2025. I'm in the SANS Bachelors of Cybersecurity program, graduating in the second half of 2026. In my free time I can be found bug hunting on platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd

## Why Cybersecurity
I used to be a gamer. I was particularly passionate about playing Minecraft with my buddies. I got into modding minecraft, and one day I decided I wanted to create my own mods. I started to learn how to code and create 3d models and all the other things involved in modding, before I eventually realized how much I loved technical challenge. I realized, I liked modding even more than I liked gaming itself. I've dwelved deeper and deeper into the weeds of computers ever since and so began my cybersecurity adventures...

## A Reflection on CTFs
CTFs have been a big part of my life. They gave me a gamified way into cybersecurity and its became a big part of my life ever since. They're  great way to learn and showcase your skills, but they're also a great tool for personal growth. Through CTFs i've learned persistence and dedication and patience, all traits I've come to value.
